Documentation, write about the hardships of getting the motor button to work (variable name the same and i was trying to make it global but it was global
                                                                                by default)

Fix Y-Offsett of elements on the main window and screenshot the code for that and update the documentation (not the writing, just images)

Adjust the window size so it's not as long and no unused space is used 

Try and mess around with the activeBG for the MOTOR button because when you click it it flashes white (write about it)

---- Try to make it so 3 leds up when you press the buttons respectively
