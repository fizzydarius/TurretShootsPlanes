to do list:
  --Make it so the windows close too, discuss with Mr Elton which windows to show and if it's worth it having the boundingRectangle and 
    drawCircle as those are simply visual aids, but they won't be seen by the user once the calibration is turned off
  --Prehaps make it so the motor cannot be turned on whilst the Calibration window is open and it won't shoot until the calibration window has been
    opened at least once
  --Look more into/ research what you actually need to send to the Arduino as a message and try to code a scrip that does that and import and use it in
    the main.py script
